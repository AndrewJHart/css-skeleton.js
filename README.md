Service can be found here: [css-skeleton.rmnet.me](http://css-skeleton.rmnet.me/)

CSS-Skeleton is a service that will take in HTML and return all of the available CSS rules for the elements.

I wrote this because I always found myself creating the HTML DOM before writing any CSS and having to go through and write out each rule. This makes it a lot quicker.

List of (hopefully) future features:
* Split code into a DOM parser and the output of CSS
* Allow for different levels of strictness
